# Multi-Input Multi-Output Morpheus Pipeline Example

## Pipeline Architecture

This example shows how to create a Morpheus pipeline with multiple inputs/outputs and even circular dataflow between stages. The pipeline visualization is:

![MIMO Pipeline](mimo_pipeline.png)

We can see that the `sample-3` stage forks its input into two paths. This is a custom stage that forks message based off whether they have the `data_len` field or not. If the field is missing, the message is routed to `add-data_len-6` which will calculate the `data_len` from the `data` field, reserialize the message, and feed it back into the `deserialize-2` stage.

This has the effect of ensuring the `data_len` field is available. To create messages where some have `data_len` missing, two datasets have been created: `with_data_len.json` and `without_data_len.json`. These datasets both contain 1000 lines and are very similar except for the missing field. Both datasets are loaded and piped into the `deserialze-2` stage where they will be interleaved.

Finally, we illustrate how to use multiple outputs by forking the `monitor-7` stage into two serialization stages. One serialization stage will exclude timestamp information (any field starting with `_ts_*`) and the other will not exclude any fields. This results in two output files that only differ by the fields that were serialized.

## Setup

This example does not require Triton Inference Server. No additional setup is required.




## MIMO Pipeline
Use Morpheus to run the MIMO Pipeline with the following command:

```
python ./examples/multi_in_multi_out/run.py
```

This example does not have any configuration options.
