# Example RabbitMQ stages
This example includes two stages `RabbitMQSourceStage` and `WriteToRabbitMQStage`

## Testing with a RabbitMQ container
Testing can be performed locally with the RabbitMQ supplied docker image from the [RabbitMQ container registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/):
```bash
docker run --rm -it --hostname my-rabbit -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3-management
```

The image can be verified with the web management console by opening http://localhost:15672 in a web browser. Enter "guest" for both the username and the password.

## Installing Pika
The `RabbitMQSourceStage` and `WriteToRabbitMQStage` stages use the [pika](https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) RabbitMQ client for Python. To install this into the current env run:
```bash
pip install -r examples/developer_guide/2_2_rabbitmq/requirements.txt
```

## Launch the reader
In a second terminal from the root of the morpheus repo execute:
```bash
python examples/developer_guide/2_2_rabbitmq/read_simple.py
```

This will read from a RabbitMQ exchange named 'logs', and write the results to `/tmp/results.json`.

If no exchange named 'logs' exists in RabbitMQ it will be created.

## Launch the writer
In a third terminal from the root of the morpheus repo execute:
```bash
python examples/developer_guide/2_2_rabbitmq/write_simple.py
```

This will read json data from the `examples/data/email.jsonlines` file and publish the data into the 'logs' RabbitMQ exchange as a single message.

The `write_simple.py` script will exit as soon as the message is written to the queue. The `read_simple.py` script on the otherhand will continue reading from the queue until explicitly shut down with a control-C.


## Alternate Morpheus CLI usage
In the above examples we defined the pipeline using the Python API in the `read_simple.py` and `write_simple.py` scripts. Alternately we could have defined the same pipelines using the Morpheus CLI tool.

### Read Pipeline
From the  Morpheus repo root directory run:
```bash
export MORPHEUS_ROOT=$(pwd)
morpheus --plugin examples/developer_guide/2_2_rabbitmq/rabbitmq_source_stage.py \
  run pipeline-other \
  from-rabbitmq --host=localhost --exchange=logs \
  monitor \
  to-file --filename=/tmp/results.json --overwrite
```

### Write Pipeline
From the  Morpheus repo root directory run:
```bash
export MORPHEUS_ROOT=$(pwd)
morpheus --plugin examples/developer_guide/2_2_rabbitmq/write_to_rabbitmq_stage.py \
  run pipeline-other \
  from-file --filename=examples/data/email.jsonlines \
  to-rabbitmq --host=localhost --exchange=logs
```
