# Morpheus SDK

NVIDIA Morpheus is an open AI application framework that provides cybersecurity developers with a highly optimized AI pipeline and pre-trained AI capabilities that, for the first time, allow them to instantaneously inspect all IP traffic across their data center fabric. Bringing a new level of security to data centers, Morpheus provides dynamic protection, real-time telemetry, adaptive policies, and cyber defenses for detecting and remediating cybersecurity threats.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [The NVIDIA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker)
- [Streamz/CuStreamz](https://streamz.readthedocs.io/)
  - The default version of `streamz` has several bugs when using an async, Dask stream. To fix this, we are temporarily using a fork of the `streamz` library. Please install with:
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/mdemoret-nv/streamz.git@async
    ```

### Installation

#### Pre-built container

Pre-built Morpheus containers will be available from NGC in the future. In the meantime, you will need to build the container manually or run the code locally.

#### Building locally (inside a container)

To manually build the container, run the following from the repo root:

```bash
docker build -t morpheus -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

This will create the `morpheus:latest` docker image. The commands to run Morpheus in the container or locally are the same. See the [Running Morpheus](#running-morpheus) section for more info.

#### Building locally (outside a container)

To build Morpheus outside of a container, first ensure all of the necessary requirements are installed (listed above). Then, from the repo root, run the following:

```bash
# For non-developers
pip install .

# For developers (Installs a symlink that allows updating the code)
pip install -e .
```

Additionally, shell command completion can be installed with:
```bash
morpheus tools autocomplete install
```
This will autodetermine your shell and the proper install location. See `morpheus tools autocomplete install --help` for more info on options and available shells.

## Running Morpheus

Depending on your configuration, it may be necessary to start additional services that Morpheus will interact with, before launching the pipeline. See the following list of stages that require additional services:

 - `from-kafka`/`to-kafka`
   - Requires a running Kafka cluster
   - See the Quick Launch Kafka section. 
 - `inf-triton`
   - Requires a running Trion server
   - See the launching Triton section.

### Quick Launch Kafka Cluster

Launching a full production Kafka cluster is outside of the scope of this project. However, if a quick cluster is needed for testing or development, one can be quickly launched via Docker Compose. The following commands outline that process. See [this](https://medium.com/big-data-engineering/hello-kafka-world-the-complete-guide-to-kafka-with-docker-and-python-f788e2588cfc) guide for more in depth information:

1. Install `docker-compose` if not already installed:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge docker-compose
   ```
2. Ensure the submodule `kafka-docker` is correctly checked out:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
3. Change directory to `kafka-docker`
   ```bash
   cd kafka-docker
   ```
4. Export the IP address of your Docker `bridge` network
   ```bash
   export KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME=$(docker network inspect bridge | jq -r '.[0].IPAM.Config[0].Gateway')
   ```
5. Update the `kafka-docker/docker-compose.yml` so the environment variable `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME` matches the previous step. For example, the line should look like: 
   ```yml
   environment:
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: 172.17.0.1
   ```
   Which should match the value of `$KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME` from the previous step:
   ```bash
   $ echo $KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME 
   "172.17.0.1"
   ```
6. Launch kafka with 3 instances
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --scale kafka=3
   ```
   In practice, 3 instances has been shown to work well. Use as many instances as required. Keep in mind each instance takes about 1 Gb of memory each.
7. Create the topic
   ```bash
   ./start-kafka-shell.sh $KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME
   $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic=$MY_INPUT_TOPIC_NAME --bootstrap-server `broker-list.sh`
   ```
   Replace `<INPUT_TOPIC_NAME>` with the input name of your choice. If you are using `to-kafka` ensure your output topic is also created.

8. Generage input messages
   1.  In order for Morpheus to read from Kafka, messages need to be published to the cluster. For debugging/testing purposes, the following container can be used:

         ```bash
         # Download from https://netq-shared.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kafka-producer.tar.gz
         wget https://netq-shared.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kafka-producer.tar.gz
         # Load container
         docker load --input kafka-producer.tar.gz
         # Run the producer container
         docker run --rm -it -e KAFKA_BROKER_SERVERS=$(broker-list.sh) -e INPUT_FILE_NAME=$MY_INPUT_FILE -e TOPIC_NAME=$MY_INPUT_TOPIC_NAME --mount src="$PWD,target=/app/data/,type=bind" kafka-producer:1
         ```
         In order for this to work, your input file must be accessable from `$PWD`.
   2. You can view the messages with:
         ```bash
         ./start-kafka-shell.sh $KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME
         $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic=$MY_TOPIC --bootstrap-server `broker-list.sh`
         ```

### Launching Triton Server

To launch Triton server, use the following command:
```bash
docker run --gpus=all --rm -p8000:8000 -p8001:8001 -p8002:8002 -v$PWD/triton_models:/models nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:21.02-py3 tritonserver --model-repository=/models --model-control-mode=poll --repository-poll-secs=1
```
This will launch Triton using the port 8001 for the GRPC server. This needs to match the Morpheus configuration.

### Launching Triton Server (With FIL Backend)

If a FIL model is required for the Morpheus pipeline, you will need a version of Triton with the FIL backend. Run the following command to build/launch Triton with a FIL backend.
```bash
# Build FIL Backend for Triton
git clone git@github.com:wphicks/triton_fil_backend.git
cd triton_fil_backend
docker build -t triton_fil -f ops/Dockerfile .

# Run Triton with FIL
docker run --gpus=all --rm -p8000:8000 -p8001:8001 -p8002:8002 -v$PWD/triton_models:/models triton_fil:latest tritonserver --model-repository=/models --model-control-mode=poll --repository-poll-secs=1
```

See the Readme in [this](github.com:wphicks/triton_fil_backend) repo for more information.

## Configuration

The Morpheus pipeline can be configured in two ways:
1. Manual configuration in Python script.
2. Configuration via the provided CLI (i.e. `morpheus`)

### Starting the Pipeline (via Manual Python Config)

See the `./examples` directory for examples on how to config via Python. More detailed instructions will be provided in the future.

### Starting the Pipeline (via CLI)

The provided CLI (`morpheus`) is capable of running the included tools as well as any linear pipeline. Instructions for using the CLI can be queried with:
```bash
$ morpheus
Usage: morpheus [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --debug / --no-debug  [default: False]
  --help                Show this message and exit.  [default: False]

Commands:
  run    Run one of the available pipelines
  tools  Run a utility tool
```
Each command in the CLI has it's own help information. Use `morpheus [command] [...sub-command] --help` to get instructions for each command and sub command. For example:
```bash
$ morpheus run pipeline-nlp inf-triton --help

Usage: morpheus run pipeline-nlp inf-triton [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --model_name TEXT  Model name in Triton to send messages to  [required]
  --server_url TEXT  Triton server URL (IP:Port)  [required]
  --help             Show this message and exit.  [default: False]
```

#### CLI Stage Configuration

When configuring a pipeline via the CLI, you start with the command `morpheus run pipeline` and then list the stages in order from start to finish. The order that the commands are placed in will be the order that data flows from start to end. The output of each stage will be linked to the input of the next. For example, to build a simple pipeline that reads from kafka, deserializes messages, serializes them, and then writes to a file, use the following:
```bash
$ morpheus run pipeline-nlp from-kafka --input_topic test_pcap deserialize serialize to-file --filename .tmp/temp_out.json
```
You should see some output similar to:
```log
====Building Pipeline====
Added source: from-kafka -> <class 'cudf.core.dataframe.DataFrame'>
Added stage: deserialize -> <class 'morpheus.pipeline.messages.MultiMessage'>
Added stage: serialize -> typing.List[str]
Added stage: to-file -> typing.List[str]
====Starting Inference====
```
This is important because it shows you the order of the stages and the output type of each one. Since some stages cannot accept all types of inputs, Morpheus will report an error if you have configured your pipeline incorrectly. For example, if we run the same command as above but forget the `serialize` stage, you will see the following:
```bash
$ morpheus run pipeline-nlp from-kafka --input_topic test_pcap deserialize to-file --filename .tmp/temp_out.json --overwrite

====Building Pipeline====
Added source: from-kafka -> <class 'cudf.core.dataframe.DataFrame'>
Added stage: deserialize -> <class 'morpheus.pipeline.messages.MultiMessage'>

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "morpheus/pipeline/pipeline.py", line 228, in build_and_start
    current_stream_and_type = await s.build(current_stream_and_type)
  File "morpheus/pipeline/pipeline.py", line 108, in build
    raise RuntimeError("The {} stage cannot handle input of {}. Accepted input types: {}".format(
RuntimeError: The to-file stage cannot handle input of <class 'morpheus.pipeline.messages.MultiMessage'>. Accepted input types: (typing.List[str],)
```
This indicates that the `to-file` stage cannot accept the input type of `morpheus.pipeline.messages.MultiMessage`. This is because the `to-file` stage has no idea how to write that class to a file, it only knows how to write strings. To ensure you have a valid pipeline, look at the `Accepted input types: (typing.List[str],)` portion of the message. This indicates you need a stage that converts from the output type of the `deserialize` stage, `morpheus.pipeline.messages.MultiMessage`, to `typing.List[str]`, which is exactly what the `serialize` stage does.

## Pipeline Stages

A complete list of the pipeline stages will be added in the future. For now, you can query the available stages for each pipeline type via:
